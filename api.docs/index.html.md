# Introduction

Welcome to the Glific API! You can use this API to access the Glific  endpoint via GraphQL. This is the
interface used between the Glific FrontEnd and BackEnd and as such is expected to be
complete, documented and tested.

We have language bindings in GraphQL and shell (for authentication).
You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.
