                  "addGroupIds": [1],
                  "deleteGroupIds": [2, 3]
              }

  ## Response
  The API response includes details of the updated contact with added and deleted groups.
  
  ## Error Codes
  No specific HTTP status codes mentioned for GraphQL, check the `errors` field in the response.
  
  ## Use Cases
  1. **Use Case 1: Successful Contact Group Update**
  
     Groups are successfully added and deleted for the contact, and the API responds with the updated contact details.
  
  2. **Use Case 2: Error Handling**
  
     If there are errors during the contact group update, the API responds with error details in the `errors` field.
  
  ## FAQ
  
  ### 1.  Groups
  **Q:** Can I add and delete groups in a single request?
  
    **A:** Yes, you can provide both `addGroupIds` and `deleteGroupIds` in the same request for simultaneous addition and deletion.
  
   **Q:** What is the meaning of `numberDeleted` in the response?
   
    **A:** `numberDeleted` indicates the count of groups successfully deleted for the contact during the update.
