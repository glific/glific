### 2. Setting up Bruno Environment

1. Set up the a new environment or change the environment to 'Globals'.
2. Variables `api_url` and `auth_token` should be present in the environment.
3. `api_url` is already set up if you have changed it to 'Globals' else the value should be `https://api.staging.tides.coloredcow.com/api`.

### 3. Collaborating using Bruno

1. To create a new request or modify an existing one, simply use the Bruno desktop app.
