## [1.5.x] -- 2021-05-09

### Added
- Finalize Stripe integration, which allows our users to leverage already existing secure systems to
make payments. This way we do not collect or store any of the private card details.
- Integrated stripe Customer portal. Now NGOs can also easily update card details whenever it is
required to make a switch to a different credit card.
- Stripe has further enabled us to support a reduced monthly pricing when NGOs want to pause the
use of platform for a few months. All your flows and staff accounts will continue to be supported
at a lower than normal monthly price.
- Added first cut of the organization onboarding form. New NGOs will simply fill out a form with
some important details to start with glific.
- In the flow editor The *has_any_words* selection for contact’s response was not working as
expected with multiple words. This has been fixed.
- the updates from new feature releases were not showing up immediately due to some caching.
It would take some time or hard reload to get the latest version. We’ve made improvements in that.
- WhatsApp has a reply feature which allows users to contextually respond to a message. Now, whenever
a contact replies to a particular message you will be able to see it through contextual
formatting in the contact's chat.
- In the previous release we added the ability for users to change the interface language to
Hindi if they wanted. We’ve been making progress to cover the entire application and leave no
spots un-translated.
- For windows, horizontal scrolling was slightly difficult since the scroll was not visible.
We’ve corrected that so that there’s a greater control in accessing the flows horizontally.
- NGOs will be able to directly record a voice message from the interface similar to how the
WhatsApp supports it, and send to a contact from the Glific chat window.
-  Previously the interface only supported attachment URLs to be included while sending a message,
now you can also upload the file from your local computer if you have Google Cloud Storage(GCS)
integration enabled. This way a GCS link gets automatically generated for your uploads.
